If your baggage is missing it is extremely important that you file a report at the Qatar Airways baggage services counter at your arrival airport. While our staff make efforts to investigate the whereabouts of your baggage you will then be given a baggage tracking number which you can use to track the status of your baggage claim. In most cases delayed baggage is located within 24 hours and once found is usually arranged for delivery to your ultimate destination (ie. home or hotel). In case you have incurred some expenses due to the late delivery of your baggage we will compensate by reimbursing your reasonable and necessary expense (conditions apply). In the event that baggage is considered to be lost then our compensation will be in accordance with the Montreal Convention where applicable.
