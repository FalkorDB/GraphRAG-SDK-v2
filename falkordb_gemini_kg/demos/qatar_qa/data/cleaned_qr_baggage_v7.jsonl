Phishing emails are intended to steal your personal data. The email will typically prompt you for personal data or direct you to a website to log into your account.

Exercise discretion when revealing personal data to unverified sources. Verify any suspicious emails or phone calls directly with the business and, if necessary, lodge a police report immediately.

However, the volume released per flight is based on a number of factors, such as aircraft efficiency and maintenance, distance travelled, the load carried (passengers and cargo) and weather conditions. Although there are several methods to calculate carbon emissions from a flight, airlines participating in the IATA carbon offset program use a methodology based on the one developed by the United Nation’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). IATA has developed th is concept further by creating a tool that allows airlines to use their own verified data on fuel burn, passenger and cargo weights, seat configurations and load factors. This tool generates the most accurate calculation of CO2 emissions per passenger yet developed. Note: All values are the averages across all flights and aircraft types for the city pair flown."}
{"anchor": "How has the IATA carbon calculator been independently endorsed?", "positive": "methodology used to calculate emissions using the airline’s data input.

For more information visit https://qasaudit.com"}

However, the relative scale of their impact is uncertain. When the internatio nal scientific community agrees on the emission factors for non -CO2 gases released by aircraft and the United Nations endorses this, the carbon calculator will be updated accordingly."}
{"anchor": "How is the type of aircraft taken into account in the carbon calculation?", "positive": "efficiency or seat configurations, and since more than one aircraft type may be used in one route, the weighted averages are calculated. flights? Question - How are the emissions calculated for journeys involving multiple together to determine the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the entire trip. Climate Change and Offsetting"}
{"anchor": "What is carbon offsetting?", "positive": "everyday actions, like using electrical equipment, heating or cooling our homes, driving a car, and flying, consume energy and produce greenhouse gas emission s. These greenhouse gas emissions, most commonly carbon dioxide (CO2), are believed to contribute to and accelerate climate change. Governments, businesses and individuals all have a responsibility to reduce the carbon emissions they produce. As well as reducing carbon emissions, it is possible to compensate for the environmental impact associated with your carbon emissions by making a financial contribution to environmental and social projects. This is known as “carbon offsetting”. More and more individuals and businesses are volunteering to offset their emissions. Offsetting can reduce the impact of our actions and help raise awareness of the issue."}
{"anchor": "How can flying impact the environment?", "positive": "into the upper atmosphere. According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, aviation accounts for approximately two per cent of total man -made carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change."}
{"anchor": "What are carbon credits?", "positive": "carbon credits generated by certified environmental and socia l projects in developing countries that are verified to offset greenhouse gas emissions. A carbon credit is a permit that represents one tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) that has either been removed from the atmosphere or prevented from being emitted. These ca rbon credits are then \"retired\" on an official register to ensure that they cannot be sold or used again. Carbon credits create a market for offsetting greenhouse gas emissions by giving a monetary value to the cost of polluting the air. There are two principal types of carbon credits: certified emission reductions (CERs) and voluntary emission reductions (VERs ). CERs are backed by the United Nations. VERs are backed by recognised quality standards, such as the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Gold Standard. VERs play an important role in emission projects with high sustainable development benefits. Ques tion - What is the role of carbon offsetting? tools available to an individual or organisation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other methods include selecting renewable energy options, improving energy efficiency at home and work, avoiding unnecessary journeys using motorised transport, cycling to work, recycling and conserving energy by turning off lights, and reducing the use of heating or air conditioning."}
{"anchor": "What is carbon offsetting for aviation?", "positive": "principle is that emissions for a flight are divided amongst the passengers. Each passenger can therefore pay to offset the emissions caused by their share of the flight’s emissions. Passengers can offset their emissions by contributing to carbon offset projects through investment in carbon credits."}
{"anchor": "What are the co -benefits of carbon offsetting?", "positive": "means to not only provide GHG reduction benefits but also co -benefits to the communities in the vicinity of carbon offset projects. Co-benefits improve social, economic, and/or ecological outcomes related to the implementation of a carbon of fset project. Typical co -benefits include improving community employment opportunities, air or water quality, biodiversity, and biological habitat conservation, energy access, and access to community health and education services.

Airlines recognise that passengers are making a voluntary donation in order to improve the environment and, hence, do not profit from their contributions. In fact, all administration costs involved in the IATA carbon offset program, including website re -development, carbon emission data collection and carbon purchasing, are borne by the airlines."}
{"anchor": "Why do different offset providers give different prices to offset the same emissions?", "positive": "conditions and quality. Carbon credits are a tradable commodity and, thus, when demand is high during periods of strong economic growth, offset prices rise and vice versa. In order to ensure st rong passenger participation, airlines participating in the IATA carbon offset program only invest in offsets of the highest quality that have been delivered and independently verified by the United Nations or other standard setting organisations, such as the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) or Gold Standard. time?
