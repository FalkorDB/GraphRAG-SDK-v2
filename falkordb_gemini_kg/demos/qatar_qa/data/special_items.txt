Phishing emails are intended to steal your personal data. The email will typically prompt you for personal data or direct you to a website to log into your account. Emails might appear to come from Qatar Airways or Privilege Club. The email address could even appear to be from a qatarairways. c om or qmiles. com address.

They might include links to spoofed websites where you are asked to provide your account login details. The spoofed website might look similar to a website from Qatar Airways or Privilege Club. What you can do to protect yourself from online fraud: Be cautious of phishing websites that appear similar to the official Qatar Airways website and to exercise caution in sharing your personal details online. Exercise discretion when revealing personal data to unverified sources. Verify any suspicious emails or phone calls directly with the business and, if necessary, lodge a police report immediately. Not interact with any suspicious emails; we advise you not to click any links within them, not to reply to them, and not to share any further information with their sender. You may also safely and permanently delete these type of emails. Before clicking on a link in the email, verify that the website address displayed matches the actual link and is not a \"masked\" website.

IATA has developed th is concept further by creating a tool that allows airlines to use their own verified data on fuel burn, passenger and cargo weights, seat configurations and load factors.
