At the airport, for any reason, if you had to load your hand baggage in the aircraft hold as checked baggage, please make sure that there are no spare batteries in that baggage. If available, please take them out and carry them in your hand baggage.  The terminals of all spare batteries must be individually protected from short circuits by placing the batteries in their original retail packaging or insulating terminals. You may insulate terminals by taping over exposed terminals or packing each battery into a separate plastic bag or a protective pouch.Please switch off all equipment containing batteries, such as cameras, laptops and mobile phones, and ensure that you take measures to prevent unintentional activation when they are carried in your checked baggage.You may not carry damaged, defective and recalled lithium batteries, and devices containing such batteries, with you, in your hand baggage or checked baggage. var ulTag = $(".whitefontP").find("ul").addClass('bulleted-list');var logoTexColor = "maroon";if (logoTexColor == 'white') { $(".whitefontP").find("ul > li").prepend('<span class="icon-arrow-strong icon-rotate-rtl qtr-txt-white"></span>');} else { $(".whitefontP").find("ul > li").prepend('<span class="icon-arrow-strong icon-rotate-rtl"></span>');} Lithium batteries classification Small (up to 100 Wh or up to 2g lithium metal) batteries include those used in mobile phones, watches, MP3 players and most original laptop batteries.Medium (100-160 Wh or up to 8g lithium metal) batteries include some extended-life batteries for laptops, and batteries used by audio or video professionals.Large (more than 160 Wh / more than 8g lithium metal) batteries are primarily used in industry and include those found in some electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as mobility devices and scooters.
